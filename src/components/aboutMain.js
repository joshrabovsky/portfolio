                Hi! I am third year student currently completing a software engineering and business dual degree through Western University and Ivey. I am a front end developer and machine learning enthusiast, who enjoys tackling difficult problems, learning new ideas, and discovering technologies. 
                </p>
                <p>
                As technology - in specific machine learning - continues to penetrate most fields, I am always on the lookout for opportunities that aim to connect business and technology. Fascinated by this intersection, I have learned more about the industries through internships as a Software Developer at Instant Record Check and as a Summer Intern for Connor, Clark, & Lunn Private Capital.
                </p>
                <p>
                During my free time I love to play basketball, travel, and eating pineapple pizza. Yes, you read that correctly.
                </p>
