                Hi! I am third year student currently completing completing a software engineering and business dual degree through Western University and Ivey. I am a front end developer and machine learning enthusiast, who enjoys tackling difficult problems, learning new ideas, and discovering technologies. 
                </p>
                <p>
                Fascinated by the intersection of business and technology, I have interned as a Software Developer at Instant Record Check and as a Summer Intern for Connor, Clark, & Lunn Private Capital. As technology - in specific machine learning - continues to penetrate most fields, I am always on the lookout for opportunities that aim to connect the two industries. 
                </p>
                <p>
                In school, I work as CO VP of Projects for Western AI and as a Developer for Western Tech Hub, while also having been CO VP Projects for Western Founders Network.
                </p>
